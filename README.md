# Doctor-Fee-Prediction
This project aims to create a web interface that allows users to predict doctor consultation fees based on their input. The machine learning model was trained on a dataset obtained by scraping data from the Practo website using Selenium. With the use of Python Pandas, the scraped data was thoroughly cleaned &amp; preprocessed for accurate predictions.
