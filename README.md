This project aims to create a web interface that allows users to predict doctor consultation fees based on their input. The machine learning model was trained on a dataset obtained by scraping data from the Practo website using Selenium. With the use of Python Pandas, the scraped data was thoroughly cleaned & preprocessed for accurate predictions.

    o	According to the Practo Highest number of Doctors present in Bangalore

    o	Most Common Degree - MBBS, MD and BDS are the Highest in Number

    o	Most number of doctors belongs to these 3 specialties -
           ‚Ä¢ Dentist 
           ‚Ä¢ Gynecologist
           ‚Ä¢ Pediatrician

   üè• Doctor Fee Prediction ML Model Creation Steps üß†

    1. **Data Collection**: Gathered doctor-related information from Practo using web scraping techniques with Selenium.

    2. Data Preprocessing: Conducted thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables into numerical representations.

    3. Feature Engineering: Derived additional relevant features from the existing dataset, such as extracting qualifications.

    4. Model Selection: Explored various regression algorithms and selected potential candidates based on initial performance evaluation.

    5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilized GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters for each selected model, optimizing their performance.

    6. Model Training: Trained multiple models on the dataset with the tuned hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy.

    7. Weighted Voting: Implemented a Weighted Voting technique, combining predictions from multiple models, each with a specific weight.

    8. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the ensemble model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure 
       prediction accuracy.

    9. Web App Development: Developed a user-friendly web application using Flask, HTML, and CSS to offer an intuitive interface for users to input parameters.
